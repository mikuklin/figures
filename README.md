# figures
This repository contains program for image dataset creation and CNN training on binary classification problem.\
rects.zip, triags.zip - created datasets of rectangles and triangles.\
To launch this project you need to `unzip rects.zip, triags.zip`.\
To train CNN you need to run command `python main.py`.\
After training is finished you can try out model. After typing "y" you can draw a triangle/rectangle with mouse and press `ctrl+S` to save figure.\
Then model wil predict class of that figure.
